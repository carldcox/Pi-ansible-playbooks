# Pi-ansible-playbooks
Repo to assist with managing several raspberry pis via ansible

Initially this repo is for managing a simple render farm with Raspberry Pi 4s and crowd-render.
There are several python scripts used with the yaml files to get everything up and running and to monitor certain aspects of the devices while performing a render across the cluster.
